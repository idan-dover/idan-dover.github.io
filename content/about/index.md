# hi there fellow human

:wave: Hi! I’m Idan, a software developer from Israel.
If you didn’t stop reading already—awesome, glad you're here!

I mostly write about the lessons and insights I’ve picked up while working in tech. Over time, I’ve learned that sharing your honest thoughts on the internet is **totally** a great idea and never backfires… ever.

So if you’ve made it this far—happy reading, and thanks for stopping by!
