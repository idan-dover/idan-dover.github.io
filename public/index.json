[{"content":"What does it mean a \u0026ldquo;syncing\u0026rdquo; boat As it sounds, you go on a boat and you sync yourself to whatever the status of the boat is. You might be building the boat yourself or you might hop onto one of your colleague\u0026rsquo;s boats, but you never observe carefully before or during the sail—you simply sync yourself to the boat you are on.\nIf it roams the high seas at tremendous speeds and you feel the wind through your hair, you sync to that. If the boat is calm and doesn’t move fast, you don’t open the sails or change direction to the wind—you just allow yourself to float on the sea to no end and let the tides take you. And of course, if the boat sinks, you sync and you sink with the boat.\nBut what does it have to do with software Say, dear developer reading this (or normal person who touches grass once in a while), have you ever been assigned to a project where you actually knew the status of the project?\nThe real status—not the bullshit the product manager says to the higher-ups via PowerPoint slides. Either the project is a nightmare to work on, and the amount of technical debt is so large it’s more likely the US will pay off its debt first, OR maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a successful project, or an app where you fix bugs from time to time, and sometimes they ask you to add a feature so small it’s like wrapping ChatGPT and adding “Do not hallucinate” to the prompt as “innovation.”\nSo you know the feeling?

But I keep going on them—even if they sink right in front of my eyes.\nLet me give you two examples I’ve personally experienced:\nA React app that had components with around 1500 lines each, about 50 useState in each component, and a useEffect that was just 500 lines long.\nAn app I’m solely responsible for that crashes regularly due to the fact it may request 1GB of data every minute.\nThe first boat I was assigned to a project after another developer left the company.

The components were too long to understand and follow. So me, a new developer, thought to myself: this needs a major refactor.

Now it fails about 10% of the time right at the start, which causes rage clicks that bring in even more data, spiraling out of control.
