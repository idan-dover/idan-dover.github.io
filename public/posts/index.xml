      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-does-it-mean-a-syncing-boat&#34;&gt;What does it mean a &amp;ldquo;syncing&amp;rdquo; boat&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it sounds, you go on a boat and you sync yourself to whatever the status of the boat is.
You might be building the boat yourself or you might hop onto one of your colleague&amp;rsquo;s boats, but you never observe carefully before or during the sail—you simply sync yourself to the boat you are on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it roams the high seas at tremendous speeds and you feel the wind through your hair, you sync to that.
If the boat is calm and doesn’t move fast, you don’t open the sails or change direction to the wind—you just allow yourself to float on the sea to no end and let the tides take you.
And of course, if the boat &lt;strong&gt;sinks&lt;/strong&gt;, you sync and you sink with the boat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
